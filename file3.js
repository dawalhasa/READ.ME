/* Now we are going to discuss how do we give the name to variable and what are rules that we have to follow in order to give variable name.
In variable name U can not use numerical like 1, 2, 3. in the beginning.
For example: like var 1value = "Bhala bhala bhala";
but U can after the variaable name like value1: this is vilid name. */

let  value1 = 2;

/* console.log( value1 * 10);
console.log( value1 / 2);
you can also enquiry the power of any number like example below.
console.log( value1 ** 2);
If want to find the square-root of 2 U can also assign as below.
console.log( value1 ** 0.5);
U can apply any mathmetic formulor in Java-Script.
But, U can use undersore or $ sign for the variable name, javascript allowed this because of they own root functiona related scripting. */

// exaple: like, 
/* let  _value = 2;
_value  = "Tashi Nyima";
console.log(_value); */
/* let  $value = 2;
$value  = "Tashi Nyima";
console.log($value); */

value1 = "Dawa Lhasa";
console.log(value1);

/* In here U r also valid to use snake case writing and camel case writing.
Example: like first_name = 2; || firstName.
These things r javascript already stored some character therefore U can use these. */
